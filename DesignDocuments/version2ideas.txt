 This might be a V2+ task: as I was looking at your site and erd: the db would be more normalized with a table for campground (since some parks have more than 1) and probably then a table for the sites, which would have campground on the table. I think this is best left for a future version. Keeping a list of things like this would show anyone looking at your repo that you realize the areas for improvement and have a plan for them.
